Protect Paigridge
=================

This is the HTML version of my Protect Paigridge game. The main back end of the game is written using native Javascript and does not use any Javascript libries. The game makes use of the HTML5 Canvas. I tried to make the source code readable and feel free to learn from or add to the code!
